## Project Description

Created simple shopping basket cart counter component that mimics typical shopping cart in web page.

## Tech Stack:

- [React](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) Create React App is an officially supported way to create single-page React applications. It offers a modern build setup with no configuration.

## Installation

- Clone this repository
  `$ git clone https://github.com/EdAncerys/react-cart-counter`
- Navigate to local repository
  `$ cd react-cart-counter`
- Install npm if you don't already have it
  `https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm`
- Install all dependencies
  `$ npm install`
- Start the server
  `$ npm start`
- Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Development Process

During development process I used an agile development methodologies of using git, commit messages, git branches, merges and regular code refactor.

## User UI view

## Further Development

Ideas to improve our application

- Expand on functionality and add more ecommerce features that compliment above functionality.
- Add shopping item list that user can interact in UI.
- Add more components, like user cart view and shopping item preview to increase complexity.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
